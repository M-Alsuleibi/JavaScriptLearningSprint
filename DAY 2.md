# DAY 2 : Basic JavaScript And Basic Data Structures

## I intend to summarize the knowledge acquired from the Frontend Master videos. However, since I don't currently have access to these courses via my GitHub Education benefits pack, which is still unavailable, I will focus on summarizing FreeCodeCamp coding exercises and including code implementation. As per GSG guidelines, once the benefits become accessible, I will watch the videos and update this file accordingly.

* [Copy Array Items Using slice()](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/copy-array-items-using-slice)
## My Solution
```javascript
function forecast(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  const array = arr.slice(2,4)
  return array;
}
