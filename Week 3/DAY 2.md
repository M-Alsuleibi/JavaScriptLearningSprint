# DAY 2: Static Typing And Scope
## Static Typing:
## Lesson Summary:
* There is a problem if you are coding nd not know anything about your types .
* Linting is a tool that applies an opnion about your code and you take a dicision based on this opnion
* Benefits and drawbacks of using tools like TypeScript and Flow for type checking:
  * Benefits:
    1. Catch type-related mistakes
    2. Communicate type intent
    3. Provide IDE feedback
  * Caveats:
    1. Inferencing is best-guess, not a guarantee
    2. Annotations are optional
    3. Any part of the application that isn't typed introduces uncertainty
* Type-Aware Linting in TS:
  * annotating
  * custom types & signatures
  * validating operand types
## Scope:
Lesson summary:
* Scope: where to look for things
  * Nested Scope
  * Hoisting
  * Closure
