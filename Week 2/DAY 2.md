# DAY 2: Closures
## Lsson Summary:
* A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.**Ref** [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
* When a function is defined, it gets a bond to the surrounding Local Memory (“Variable Environment”) in which it has been defined.

        - Persistent Lexical Scope Referenced Data (P.L.S.R.D.)
        - ‘Backpack’
