# Day 1: Introduction, JavaScript Principles, Functions & Callbacks: 
# JavaScript Principles:
## Lesson Summary:
When JavaScript code runs, it :
1. Goes through the code
line-by-line and runs/ ’executes’
each line - known as **the thread
of execution**
1. Saves ‘data’ like strings and
arrays so we can use that data
later - in its **memory**
We can even save code
(‘functions’)
1. Execution context: Functions
Created to run the code of a
function - has 2 parts (we’ve
already seen them!)
- Thread of execution
- Memory

4. **Call stack** : JavaScript keeps track of what
function is currently running
(where’s the thread of execution)
### The three core components of JS :
1. Memory to store data 
1. Thread of execution to go run line-by-line
1. Call stack to keep track where is our thread of execution is using our call stack 
# Functions & Callbacks:
## Lesson Summary:
* Generalize the function to make it reusable and to preserve the the principle _**DRY**_(Don't Repeat Yourself)
    * Parameters mean we don’t need to decide what data to run our functionality on until we run the function and then 
    * Then provide an actual value (argument) when we run the function.
