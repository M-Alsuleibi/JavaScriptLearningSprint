# Day 1: Introduction, JavaScript Principles, Functions & Callbacks: 
# JavaScript Principles:
## Lesson Summary:
When JavaScript code runs, it :
1. Goes through the code
line-by-line and runs/ ’executes’
each line - known as **the thread
of execution**
1. Saves ‘data’ like strings and
arrays so we can use that data
later - in its memory
We can even save code
(‘functions’)
