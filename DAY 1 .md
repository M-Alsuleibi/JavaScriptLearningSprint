# DAY 1 : Introduction,DOM,Values & Data Types And Operators

## I intend to summarize the knowledge acquired from the Frontend Master videos. However, since I don't currently have access to these courses via my GitHub Education benefits pack, which is still unavailable, I will focus on summarizing FreeCodeCamp coding exercises and including code implementation. As per GSG guidelines, once the benefits become accessible, I will watch the videos and update this file accordingly.
 # Coding Exercises
* [Find the Length of a String](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/find-the-length-of-a-string)
## My Solution
```javascript
// Setup
let lastNameLength = 0;
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
lastNameLength = lastName.length ;

``` 
* [Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/use-bracket-notation-to-find-the-nth-to-last-character-in-a-string)

## My Solution
```javascript
// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length -2]; // Change this line

```
