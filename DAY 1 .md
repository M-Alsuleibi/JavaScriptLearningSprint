# DAY 1 : Introduction,DOM,Values & Data Types And Operators

## I intend to summarize the knowledge acquired from the Frontend Master videos. However, since I don't currently have access to these courses via my GitHub Education benefits pack, which is still unavailable, I will focus on summarizing FreeCodeCamp coding exercises and including code implementation. As per GSG guidelines, once the benefits become accessible, I will watch the videos and update this file accordingly.
